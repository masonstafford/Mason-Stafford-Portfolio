# Mason-Stafford-Portfolio


Project Description: Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. â€“ Make a responsive web-portfolio with 3 pages using bootstrap grids.

Tasks Accomplished: I made index.html, contact.html and portfolio.html pages. I made a responsive layout using bootstrap grids with responsive images. I included the grid, columns and rows within that grid. I think I made it look pretty good too.
